		<p>The Otago Ski Club is a sports club for skiers (and snowboarders), which has been based in the Otago region of New Zealand since it was first established in 1932.</p><br>
		<p>The club operates “Joel Lodge”, a lodge situated at the top of Coronet Peak Road, a short walk from the bottom of the chairlift. The club offers what no hotel in the Queenstown Lakes District can: affordable, peak-side accommodation on Coronet Peak with the convenience of being only ten minutes walk from the base buildings!</p><br>
		<p>The lodge operates during the winter ski season, and in recent years also over summer, providing accommodation for groups or individuals participating in outdoor recreation activities.</p><br>
		<p>Be among the first on the mountain and rest in the knowledge that after the end of the day, you have only a short distance to walk or slide to your accommodation and aprés ski.</p><br>
		<p>The lodge has cooking facilities that guests can use, and there are shared catered meals arranged by the caretakers on the busy winter weekends.</p><br>
		<p>We’re a friendly, family-oriented club, and are always open to new members. If you’re planning on spending some time in Queenstown – either in Winter or Summer, give us a try.</p>
